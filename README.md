# AWS DevOps Essentials

## An Introductory Workshop on CI/CD Practices

In few hours, quickly learn how to effectively leverage various AWS services to improve developer productivity and reduce the overall time to market for new product capabilities. In this session, we will demonstrate a prescriptive approach to incrementally adopt and embrace some of the best practices around continuous integration & delivery using AWS Developer Tools and 3rd party solutions including, AWS CodeCommit (a managed source control service), AWS CodeBuild (a fully managed build service), Jenkins (an open source automated build server), CodePipeline (a fully managed continuous delivery service), and CodeDeploy (an automated application deployment service). We will also highlight some best practices and productivity tips that can help make your software release process fast, automated, and reliable.

See the diagram below for a depiction of the complete architecture.

## Prerequisites

* **Configure AWS CodeCommit:** The easiest way to set up AWS CodeCommit is to configure HTTPS Git credentials for AWS CodeCommit. On the user details page in IAM console, choose the **Security Credentials** tab, and in **HTTPS Git credentials for AWS CodeCommit**, choose **Generate**. ![HTTPS Git Credential](./img/codecommit-iam-gc1.png)
        **ðŸ’¡ Note:** Make Note of the Git HTTP credentials handy. It will be used for cloning and pushing changes to Repo.
          Also, You can find detail instruction on how to configure HTTPS Git Credential [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-gc.html)
* **IAM Permissions:** Finally, for the AWS account ensure you have sufficient privileges. You must have permissions for the following services:

AWS Identity and Access Management

Amazon Simple Storage Service

AWS CodeCommit

AWS CodeBuild

AWS CloudFormation

AWS CodeDeploy

AWS CodePipeline

AWS Cloud9

Amazon EC2

Amazon SNS

### **Important:**

<<<<<<< HEAD
Select the region of your choice for the lab. Kindly the select the region which has all four Code* services. You can find the [region services list](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/). Stick to the same region throughout all labs. **Make sure you have not reached the VPC or Internet Gateway limits for that region. If you already have 5 VPCs/IGWs, delete at least one before you proceed or choose an alternate region.**

## Lab 1 - Build project on the cloud

### AWS Cloud9 IDE - Set up

AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential tools for popular programming languages and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) pre-installed so you don't need to install files or configure your laptop for this workshop. Your Cloud9 environment will have access to the same AWS resources as the user with which you logged into the AWS Management Console.

Take a moment now and setup your Cloud9 development environment.

### âœ…  Step-by-step Instructions**

1. Go to the AWS Management Console, click **Services** then select **Cloud9** under Developer Tools.
2. Click **Create environment**.
3. Enter `MyDevEnvironment` into **Name** and optionally provide a **Description**.
4. Click **Next step**.
5. You may leave **Environment settings** at their defaults of launching a new **t2.micro** EC2 instance which will be paused after **30 minutes** of inactivity.
6. Click **Next step**.
7. Review the environment settings and click **Create environment**. It will take several minutes for your environment to be provisioned and prepared.
8. Once ready, your IDE will open to a welcome screen. Below that, you should see a terminal prompt similar to: ![setup](./img/setup-cloud9-terminal.png) You can run AWS CLI commands in here just like you would on your local computer. Verify that your user is logged in by running `aws sts get-caller-identity`.

```cmd
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

You'll see output indicating your account and user information:

```cmd
Admin:~/environment $ aws sts get-caller-identity
```

```cmd
{
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "UserId": "AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Alice"
}
```

Keep your AWS Cloud9 IDE opened in a tab throughout this workshop as we'll use it for activities like cloning, pushing changes to repository and using the AWS CLI.

### ðŸ’¡ Tips

Keep an open scratch pad in Cloud9 or a text editor on your local computer for notes. When the step-by-step directions tell you to note something such as an ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN), copy and paste that into the scratch pad.

***

### Stage 1: Create an AWS CodeCommit Repository

**_To create the AWS CodeCommit repository (console)_**

1. Open the AWS CodeCommit console at <https://console.aws.amazon.com/codecommit>.
2. In the region selector, choose the region where you will create the repository. For more information, see [Regions and Git Connection Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/regions.html).
3. On the Welcome page, choose Get Started Now. (If a **_Dashboard_** page appears instead, choose **_Create repository_**.)
4. On the **_Create repository_** page, in the **_Repository name_** box, type **_WebAppRepo_**.
5. In the **_Description_** box, type **_My demonstration repository_**.
6. Choose **_Create repository_** to create an empty AWS CodeCommit repository named **_WebAppRepo_**.

**_Note_** The remaining steps in this tutorial assume you have named your AWS CodeCommit repository **_WebAppRepo_**. If you use a name other than **_WebAppRepo_**, be sure to use it throughout this tutorial. For more information about creating repositories, including how to create a repository from the terminal or command line, see [Create a Repository](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/how-to-create-repository.html).

***

### Stage 2: Clone the Repo

In this step, you will connect to the source repository created in the previous step. Here, you use Git to clone and initialize a copy of your empty AWS CodeCommit repository. Then you specify the user name and email address used to annotate your commits.

1. From CodeCommit Console, you can get the **https clone url** link for your repo.
2. Go to Cloud9 IDE terminal prompt
3. Run git clone to pull down a copy of the repository into the local repo:

```cmd
git clone https://git-codecommit.<YOUR-REGION>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/WebAppRepo

```

Provide your Git HTTPs credential when prompted. You would be seeing the following message if cloning is successful. ***warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.***

***

### Stage 3: Commit changes to Remote Repo

1. Download the Sample Web App Archive by running the following command from IDE terminal.

```cmd
wget https://github.com/awslabs/aws-devops-essential/raw/master/sample-app/Web-App-Archive.zip
```

2. Unarchive and copy all the **_contents_** of the unarchived folder to your local repo folder.

```cmd
unzip Web-App-Archive.zip
mv -v Web-App-Archive/* WebAppRepo/
```

After moving the files, your local repo should like the one below. ![cloud9](./img/Cloud9-IDE-Screen-Sample.png)
3. Change the directory to your local repo folder. Run **_git add_** to stage the change:

```cmd
cd WebAppRepo
git add *
```

4. Run **_git commit_** to commit the change:

```cmd
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
```

**_ðŸ’¡ Tip_** To see details about the commit you just made, run **_git log_**.

5. Run **_git config credential_** to store the credential.

```cmd
git config credential.helper store
```

6. Run **_git push_** to push your commit through the default remote name Git uses for your AWS CodeCommit repository (origin), from the default branch in your local repo (master):

```cmd
git push -u origin master
```

Provide your Git HTTPs credential when prompted. Credential helper will store it, hence you won't be asked again for subsequent push.

**_ðŸ’¡ Tip_** After you have pushed files to your AWS CodeCommit repository, you can use the AWS CodeCommit console to view the contents. For more information, see [Browse the Contents of a Repository](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/how-to-browse.html).

***

### Stage 4: Prepare Build Service

1. First, let us create the necessary roles required to finish labs. Run the CloudFormation stack to create service roles.
  Ensure you are launching it in the same region as your AWS CodeCommit repo.

```cmd
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name DevopsWorkshop-roles --template-body https://github.com/awslabs/aws-devops-essential/raw/master/templates/01-aws-devops-workshop-roles.template --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

**_Tip_** To learn more about AWS CloudFormation, please refer to [AWS CloudFormation UserGuide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)

2. Upon completion take a note on the service roles created. Check [describe-stacks](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/describe-stacks.html) to find the output of the stack.

3. For Console, refer to the CloudFormation [Outputs tab](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-view-stack-data-resources.html) to see output. A S3 Bucket is also created. Make a note of this bucket. This will be used to store the output from CodeBuild in the next step. **_Sample Output:_** ![](./img/cfn-output.png)
4. Let us **create CodeBuild** project from **CLI**. To create the build project using AWS CLI, we need JSON-formatted input.
    **_Create_** a json file named **_'create-project.json'_** under 'MyDevEnvironment'. ![](./img/create-json.png) Copy the content below to create-project.json. (Replace the placeholders marked with **_<<>>_** with your own values.) To know more about the codebuild project json [review the spec](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/create-project.html#create-project-cli).

```json
{
  "name": "devops-webapp-project",
  "source": {
    "type": "CODECOMMIT",
    "location": "https://git-codecommit.<<YOUR-REGION-ID>>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/WebAppRepo"
  },
  "artifacts": {
    "type": "S3",
    "location": "<<YOUR-CODEBUILD-OUTPUT-BUCKET>>",
    "packaging": "ZIP",
    "name": "WebAppOutputArtifact.zip"
  },
  "environment": {
    "type": "LINUX_CONTAINER",
    "image": "aws/codebuild/java:openjdk-8",
    "computeType": "BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL"
  },
  "serviceRole": "<<BuildRoleArn-Value-FROM-CLOUDFORMATION-OUTPUT>>"
}
```

5. Switch to the directory that contains the file you just saved, and run the **_create-project_** command:

```cmd
aws codebuild create-project --cli-input-json file://create-project.json
```

6. Sample output JSON for your reference

```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "project-name",
    "description": "description",
    "serviceRole": "serviceRole",
    "tags": [
      {
        "key": "tags-key",
        "value": "tags-value"
      }
    ],
    "artifacts": {
      "namespaceType": "namespaceType",
      "packaging": "packaging",
      "path": "path",
      "type": "artifacts-type",
      "location": "artifacts-location",
      "name": "artifacts-name"
    },
    "lastModified": lastModified,
    "timeoutInMinutes": timeoutInMinutes,
    "created": created,
    "environment": {
      "computeType": "computeType",
      "image": "image",
      "type": "environment-type",
      "environmentVariables": [
        {
          "name": "environmentVariable-name",
          "value": "environmentVariable-value",
          "type": "environmentVariable-type"
        }
      ]
    },
    "source": {
      "type": "source-type",
      "location": "source-location",
      "buildspec": "buildspec",
      "auth": {
        "type": "auth-type",
        "resource": "resource"
      }
    },
    "encryptionKey": "encryptionKey",
    "arn": "arn"
  }
}
```

7. If successful, output JSON should have values such as:
  * The lastModified value represents the time, in Unix time format, when information about the build project was last changed.
  * The created value represents the time, in Unix time format, when the build project was created.
  * The ARN value represents the ARN of the build project.

**_Note_** Except for the build project name, you can change any of the build project's settings later. For more information, see [Change a Build Project's Settings (AWS CLI)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/change-project.html#change-project-cli).

***

### Stage 5: Let's build the code on cloud

1. A build spec is a collection of build commands and related settings in YAML format, that AWS CodeBuild uses to run a build.
    Create a file namely, **_buildspec.yml_** under **WebAppRepo** folder. Copy the content below to the file and save it. To know more about [how CodeBuild works](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/concepts.html#concepts-how-it-works).

```
version: 0.1

phases:
  install:
    commands:
      - echo Nothing to do in the install phase...
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Nothing to do in the pre_build phase...
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build started on `date`
      - mvn install
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Build completed on `date`
artifacts:
  files:
    - target/javawebdemo.war
  discard-paths: yes
```

As a sample shown below:

![buildspec](./img/build-spec.png)

**_Note_** Visit this [page](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html) to know more about build spec and how you can use multiple build specs in the same repo.

2. Run the **_start-build_** command:

```cmd
aws codebuild start-build --project-name devops-webapp-project
```

**_Note:_** You can start build with more advance configuration setting via JSON. If you are interested to learn more about it, please visit [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/run-build.html#run-build-cli).

3. If successful, data would appear showing successful submission. Make a note of the build id value. You will need it in the next step.
4. In this step, you will view summarized information about the status of your build.

```cmd
aws codebuild batch-get-builds --ids <<ID>>
```

**_Note:_** Replace <<ID>> with the id value that appeared in the output of the previous step.

5. Did the build succeed? if the build failed, why? The reason is build spec YAML file is not pushed to the repository. Push the code changes by **git add, commit, and push**. **Repeat** steps from 2 through 4.
6. You will also be able to view detailed information about your build in CloudWatch Logs. You can complete this step by visiting the AWS CodeBuild console.
7. In this step, you will verify the **_WebAppOutputArtifact.zip_** file that AWS CodeBuild built and then uploaded to the output bucket. You can complete this step by **visiting** the **AWS CodeBuild console** or the **Amazon S3 console**.

**_Note:_** Troubleshooting CodeBuild - Use the [information](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html) to help you identify, diagnose, and address issues.

### Summary:

This **concludes Lab 1**. In this lab, we successfully created repository with version control using AWS CodeCommit and built our code on the cloud using AWS CodeBuild service.

**_âœ… Do It Yourself (DIY):_** Using the CodeCommit Console try to do the following tasks. - Create an additional branch within your repository.

* Make changes to the new branch and compare the changes between branches.
* Enable triggers on your repository for specific events.

***

## Lab 2 - Automate deployment for testing

### Stage 1: Prepare environment for Testing

1. Run the CloudFormation stack using the following AWS CLI command:

```
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name DevopsWorkshop-Env --template-body https://github.com/awslabs/aws-devops-essential/raw/master/templates/02-aws-devops-workshop-environment-setup.template --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

**_Note_**
  - The Stack will have a VPC w/ 1 public subnet, an IGW, route tables, ACL, 2 EC2 instances. Also, the EC2 instances will be launched with a User Data script to **automatically install the AWS CodeDeploy agent**.
  - **Verify** that by visiting the **EC2 Console** and view option for **user data**.You would see the following script.

```cmd
#!/bin/bash -ex
yum install -y aws-cli
cd /home/ec2-user/
wget https://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/codedeploy-agent.noarch.rpm
yum -y install codedeploy-agent.noarch.rpm
service codedeploy-agent start
```

  - You can refer to [this instruction](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/codedeploy-agent-operations-install.html) to install the CodeDeploy agent for other OSs like Amazon Linux, RHEL, Ubuntu, or Windows.
  - AWS CodeDeploy can deploy to both Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises instances.To know more [visit](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/instances.html).

***

### Stage 2: Create CodeDeploy Application and Deployment group

1. Run the following to create an application for CodeDeploy.

```cmd
aws deploy create-application --application-name DevOps-WebApp
```

2. Run the following to create a deployment group and associates it with the specified application and the user's AWS account. You need to replace the service role with **DeployRoleArn Value** we created using roles CFN stack.

```cmd
aws deploy create-deployment-group --application-name DevOps-WebApp  --deployment-config-name CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime --deployment-group-name DevOps-WebApp-BetaGroup --ec2-tag-filters Key=Name,Value=DevWebApp01,Type=KEY_AND_VALUE --service-role-arn <<REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-CODEDEPLOY-ROLE-ARN>>
```

**_Note:_** We are using the tags to attach instances to the deployment group.

3. Let us review all the changes by visiting the CodeDeploy Console.

***

### Stage 3: Prepare application for deployment

1. Without an AppSpec file, AWS CodeDeploy cannot map the source files in your application revision to their destinations or run scripts at various stages of the deployment.
2. Copy the template into a text editor and save the file as **_appspec.yml_** in the **_WebAppRepo_** directory of the revision.

```yml
version: 0.0
os: linux
files:
  - source: /target/javawebdemo.war
    destination: /tmp/codedeploy-deployment-staging-area/
  - source: /scripts/configure_http_port.xsl
    destination: /tmp/codedeploy-deployment-staging-area/
hooks:
  ApplicationStop:
    - location: scripts/stop_application
      timeout: 300
  BeforeInstall:
    - location: scripts/install_dependencies
      timeout: 300
  ApplicationStart:
    - location: scripts/write_codedeploy_config.sh
    - location: scripts/start_application
      timeout: 300
  ValidateService:
    - location: scripts/basic_health_check.sh

```

As a sample shown below:

![appspec](./img/app-spec.png)

3. **_Review_** the **_script folder_** in the repo for the various scripts like Start, Stop, health check etc. These scripts will be called as per the hook definition in **_appspec.yml_** file during deployment.
4. Since we are going to deploy the application via CodeDeploy, we need to package additional files needed by CodeDeploy. Let us **_make change_** to the **_buildspec.yml_** to incorporate the changes.

```yml
version: 0.1

phases:
  install:
    commands:
      - echo Nothing to do in the install phase...
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Nothing to do in the pre_build phase...
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build started on `date`
      - mvn install
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Build completed on `date`
artifacts:
  files:
    - appspec.yml
    - scripts/**/*
    - target/javawebdemo.war

```

5. Save the changes to buildspec.yml. Run **_git add, commit, and push_** the changes to CodeCommit repo.
